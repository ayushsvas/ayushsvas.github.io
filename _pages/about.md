<h2>About me</h2>

(This website is not up-to-date)

Hi! I am Ayush. Currently, I am a student at University of Göttingen (Georg-August-Universität Göttingen) pursuing masters in Theoretical Physics.

I enjoy physics, mathematics and computer science. I am really fond of this whole research avenue of understanding machine learning using field theory. Personally, I wish to work on the problem of understanding black-box of deep learning architectures using field-theoretical methods.

Apart from being the benign neighbourhood nerd, I also like to play football and computer games.  
 
<h2>Research Interests</h2>
- Quantum field theory  
- Machine learning
